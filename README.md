# my-library-app

This is an exercise from the javaScript course in Odin

- In this feature instead of using the object constructor function, we used have used a class constructor to create the books

Issues:

> The event listener for changing the background of the book card on checking the "read" mark only works for the first element despite trying to debug it for a day.

> I need to figure out a way to close the sidebar on submitting the form

> I need to figure out a way to reject an empty form input

> The backdrop filter is not compatible with safari
