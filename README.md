# my-library-app

This is an exercise from the javaScript course in Odin

Issues:

> The event listener for changing the background of the book card on checking the "read" mark only works for the first element despite trying to debug it for a day.
> I need to figure out a way to close the sidebar on submitting the form
> I need to figure out a way to reject an empty form input
> The backdrop filter is not compatible with safari
