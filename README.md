# my-library-app

This is an exercise from the javaScript course in Odin

- In this feature instead of using the object constructor function, we used have used a class constructor to create the books


> Fixes

Added the necessary back-drop filters to the app

fixed the text overflow using: [word-wrap: break-word] on the description box.

fixed the form to flow the input rules when submitting data using the submit event listener and inside it [event.preventDefault();]


> Improvement

Add a backend where people can upload books

add a schema through which people can create accounts
